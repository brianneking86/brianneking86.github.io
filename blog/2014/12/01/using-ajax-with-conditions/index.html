<div class="entry-content"><p>So Javascript week was a tough week, to say the least. I felt like I had no idea what I was doing which I guess I expected to be used to by then. At least when learning the ever so wonderful Ruby, it gives you error messages that mean something. Seeing the words &ldquo;undefined is not a function&rdquo; is one of the most infuriating things ever in life and thats if you only see it once! Seeing it every 5 seconds slowly picked away at my will to live or at least to continue coding.</p>

<p>For some reason that I don&rsquo;t understand, at some point during the week things started to make a little bit of sense. By the end of the week, I had a vague idea that I maybe kind of had an inkling of what to do. Of course, all of this meant that I was inevitably going to get super determined to figure out something difficult on my own to prove that I wasn&rsquo;t a total moron. In the case of Javascript I found my &ldquo;something difficult&rdquo; during the rails task-lister lab. I created the basic setup with lists that have many tasks and then added boards that have many lists. On the board index page each &lsquo;div&rsquo; would be for a board and the line items in that &lsquo;div&rsquo; would be the lists associated with the board. Seems simple.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brianneking86/brianneking86.github.io/source/source/images/board_index.png" title="Board Index Page" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>On the board show page each &lsquo;div&rsquo; would be a list that belonged to the board and the line items would be the tasks associated with that list.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brianneking86/brianneking86.github.io/source/source/images/board_show.png" title="Board Show Page" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>This presented a problem if I wanted to be able to add a list from either page. On the board index page, a list would get appended as a line item but on the board show page it would get appended as a whole div with the potential for line items. I had checked out Trello to make sure I wasn&rsquo;t crazy and that it was possible but it was set up in a way that would have dealt with the issue so of course that meant that my best bet on getting an answer was Steven, poor guy.</p>

<p>Of course I grabbed him on his way out the door to freedom and he kindly (if not somewhat begrudgingly) offered to help out. I poorly explained the situation to him (probably about as well as above) and thankfully he understood and explained that the solution was actually not as difficult as I thought. After persisting the new list to the database, the next stop along the way is the create.js.erb file where I just had to create a condition statement that would check the page for specific css elements. To break that down a little bit more, check the page for either something specific to the board index page that won&rsquo;t be found on the board show page, if it finds that element then render one html.erb template otherwise render a different template. Doesn&rsquo;t sound too hard, right?!</p>

<p>This time amazingly it wasn&rsquo;t. My initial create.js.erb file looked like this.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brianneking86/brianneking86.github.io/source/source/images/original.png" title="Board Index Page" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>Using the method .length in javascript on a certain css selector will allow you to see if that element is anywhere to be found. All you need to do is check the &ldquo;.length&rdquo; of a certain element and then render the correct partial. Once I added my conditional, it looks like this.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brianneking86/brianneking86.github.io/source/source/images/updated.png" title="Board Index Page" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>Adding five lines of code and one additional partial that I called &ldquo;_board_list.html.erb&rdquo; I had my answer. The &ldquo;board_list.html.erb&rdquo; partial contains one simple &lsquo;li&rsquo; line of html. The original &ldquo;list.html.erb&rdquo; contained the html for the &lsquo;div&rsquo; and didn&rsquo;t need to be modified at all.</p>

<p>Honestly the most important thing I learned in all of this is that just because something seems really difficult doesn&rsquo;t mean it is and mostly figuring out the right question to ask is the hardest part. If I wanted to do it, there&rsquo;s a pretty good chance someone else had the same idea at some point and figured out a way. There is so much more to learn of the wonders of javascript/ajax and while I still lovingly refer to the language as &ldquo;code vomit on the screen&rdquo;, I&rsquo;m actually totally motivated to learn more :)</p>
