One of the quotes I have heard/seen most often at Flatiron is "You will never know less than you know right now." For me, one of the first lessons I learned after starting coding is that asking for help/needing help doesn't mean you're stupid. It means you're learning something challengind. That being said, it can be incredibly frustrating when you're pretty sure you're smart but you just can't seem to get past one stupid line of code in a line!

While struggling through my first two and a half weeks here at Flatiron I am greatful to have found a few resources that have become my saviors (aside from the TA's and fellow classmates of course!)
 ** - Rubular.com  - binding.pry  - www.ruby-doc.org **


###Rubular.com

Rubular.com helped me defeat what was one of my first enemies here at Flatiron - Regex! Oh how I hated regex when I first started with it. It took multiple sit downs with TA's, watching lab reviews and sitting down at home with Rubular and the advanced regex lab to finally gain understanding. It was brutal



After I learned of Rubular.com, one of our wonderful TA's sat down with me and explained exactly how it all worked. Still, I had difficulty until I got even further explanation and then it all seemed to click (I hope anyway). From what I can tell Regex is an incredibly powerful tool and my ability to use it and actually understand what it means was a huge triumph. Thankfully I was home alone when I got it all to click otherwise everyone else at Flatiron would certainly think I was nuts.
